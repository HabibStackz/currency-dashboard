## Information
The Currency Converter is a website that allows users to convert values from one currency to another. The program currently supports two different currencies: dollars and sterling. Users can select the currency they want to convert from and enter a value to have it converted into the other currency. The program uses real-time exchange rates to ensure that the conversions are accurate and up-to-date.

The Currency Converter is built using JavaScript and is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. It is ideal for anyone who needs to convert currencies on a regular basis, such as business owners, travelers, or anyone who makes transactions online.

The program currently only supports 2 different currencies. However, we are working on adding more
